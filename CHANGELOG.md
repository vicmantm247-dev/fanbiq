# Changelog

All notable changes to Swiparr will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
-

### Changed
- **CSP headers moved to middleware**: Content-Security-Policy is now built entirely in `proxy.ts` instead of `next.config.ts`, enabling runtime env vars like `CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS` to take effect. `next.config.ts` `headers()` runs AFTER middleware in Next.js, so the CSP must be set in the middleware to avoid being overwritten.
- **X-Frame-Options auto-syncs with CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS**: When `CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS` is set to a value that allows iframing (e.g., `'self'`), `X-Frame-Options` is automatically set to `SAMEORIGIN` to avoid conflicting with the permissive `frame-ancestors` directive. Explicit `X_FRAME_OPTIONS` or `DISABLED` overrides still work.

### Fixed
- CSP `frame-ancestors` now respects `CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS` env var instead of being hardcoded to `'none'`
