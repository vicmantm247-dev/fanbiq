## 🚀 Quick Start

### Fastest: Swiparr Global

**No setup, no server, no problem.**

🌐 **[swiparr.com](https://swiparr.com)** - Free to use, community-supported (hopefully)

### Easiest: Deploy to Vercel

One-click deployment, perfect for personal or small group use:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fm3sserstudi0s%2Fswiparr&env=PROVIDER,TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN,USE_SECURE_COOKIES,PROVIDER_LOCK&envDefaults=%7B%22PROVIDER%22%3A%22tmdb%22%2C%22USE_SECURE_COOKIES%22%3A%22true%22%2C%22PROVIDER_LOCK%22%3A%22true%22%7D&envDescription=Get%20a%20TMDB%20Access%20Token%20to%20continue%20with%20TMDB%20(no%20media%20server%20needed)%2C%20or%20set%20another%20PROVIDER%20(jellyfin%2C%20plex%2C%20emby)%2C%20or%20set%20PROVIDER_LOCK%20to%20%22false%22%20to%20configure%20the%20provider%20(any)%20at%20run-time.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fm3sserstudi0s%2Fswiparr%3Ftab%3Dreadme-ov-file%23environment-variable-matrix&project-name=swiparr&repository-name=swiparr&demo-title=Swiparr&demo-description=Discover%20what%20to%20watch%20next%2C%20by%20yourself%20or%20together.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fswiparr.com&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fswiparr.com%2Ficon1.png&products=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22tursocloud%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22database%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D)

Note: The automatic deployment workflow in Vercel uses the Turso integration by default as a database service provider. Free to set up, possible to swap out [^1].

**Vercel security note:** `AUTH_SECRET` is auto-generated during the build (via `scripts/ensure-auth-secret.cjs`) and persisted in the database when not provided.



### Full Control: Self-Host with Docker

**Using Docker Compose (Recommended):**

1. Create `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  swiparr:
    image: ghcr.io/m3sserstudi0s/swiparr:latest
    container_name: swiparr
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PROVIDER=jellyfin  # or plex, emby, tmdb (or set PROVIDER_LOCK to "false")
      - JELLYFIN_URL=http://your-jellyfin:8096 # adjust to provider, none without server lock
    volumes:
      - ./swiparr-data:/app/data
    ports:
      - 4321:4321
```

2. Run it:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Using Docker CLI:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name swiparr \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 4321:4321 \
  -v $(pwd)/swiparr-data:/app/data \
  -e PROVIDER=jellyfin \
  -e JELLYFIN_URL=http://your-jellyfin:8096 \
  ghcr.io/m3sserstudi0s/swiparr:latest
```

3. Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)

**Docker security note:** `AUTH_SECRET` is auto-generated on first boot (via `scripts/ensure-auth-secret.cjs`) and stored in the database when not provided.

[^1]: Can be set to a local file (internal to container) OR external URL. Mostly relevant for Vercel deployments, which uses the Turso integration in the set-up workflow by default where these values are auto-generated and -injected. Can of course be swapped out with a database service provider of choice.

[^2]: Only applicable for providers with authentication (Jellyfin, Plex, Emby). Admin role ownership is tracked per-provider. Defaults to the first user of that provider that logs in (if supported), or matching env vars. Admin capabilities are disabled for providers without built-in authentication (like TMDB).

## Features (Deep dive)

### Session Settings

When you create a session, customize it for your group:

<details>
<summary><strong>Match Strategies</strong></summary>

- **Two or More**: Any two people liking the same content creates a match
  - Best for: Larger groups where majority rules
  - Finding: Quick results, more options

- **Unanimous**: Everyone must like it for a match
  - Best for: Smaller groups wanting guaranteed crowd-pleasers
  - Finding: Fewer but higher-quality matches
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Session Restrictions</strong></summary>

- **Max Likes**: Limit right swipes per person
  - Forces thoughtful, selective choices
  - Prevents mindless approval

- **Max Nopes**: Limit left swipes per person
  - Stops serial negativity
  - Encourages open-mindedness

- **Max Matches**: Auto-stop when you have enough options
  - Perfect for when you just need 3-4 solid picks
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Guest Lending (Account Sharing)</strong></summary>


**How it works:**

1. Host enables "Guest Lending" in settings
2. Guest joins session with just a name - no account needed
3. Swiparr uses the host's credentials to fetch content
4. Guest gets a unique ID, their swipes are tracked separately
5. Guests cannot access host account or modify settings

**Security note:** Host credentials are stored server-side and encrypted at rest using `AUTH_SECRET` while Guest Lending is enabled. See "Generating `AUTH_SECRET`" in Security & Privacy.

**Perfect for:** Movie nights with friends who don't have media servers
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Admin Role</strong></summary>


**Automatically Assigned:** First user to log in for each provider becomes that provider's admin.

**Manual Assignment:** Set `ADMIN_USERNAME` (global) or `[PROVIDER]_ADMIN_USERNAME` (e.g., `JELLYFIN_ADMIN_USERNAME`) environment variables.

**Admin Privileges:**
- Configure included media libraries for the provider
- Manage global provider settings
- Override session restrictions
- Access admin dashboard (only for providers with authentication)
</details>

---

## 🔄 Provider Flexibility: Two Modes

### Server Lock Mode

>PROVIDER_LOCK=true

**One provider, admin-controlled**

- Admin configures ONE provider in environment variables
- All users automatically use this provider
- Best for: Families, roommates, shared media servers

### BYOP Mode

>PROVIDER_LOCK=false

**Bring Your Own Provider**

- Each user connects their own provider during onboarding
- Users can switch providers anytime
- Best for: Users with different media servers, and/or you have none

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Generating `AUTH_SECRET` (optional)**:

```bash
# macOS and Linux
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Windows users can use https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32.

- **Encrypted Sessions**: iron-session with secure, encrypted cookies
- **Encrypted Guest Lending Tokens**: host access tokens are encrypted at rest when Guest Lending is enabled
- **Scoped Access**: Guests can only swipe, no account access
- **Data Ownership**: Self-hosted = your data stays on your server
- **Provider Isolation**: No credential sharing in BYOP mode
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for safe media server integration
- **Security Headers**: X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, Referrer-Policy
- **Network Safety**: Private/LAN provider URLs are blocked by default; enable via `ALLOW_PRIVATE_PROVIDER_URLS`
- **Mode Awareness**: Env-configured providers are trusted when `PROVIDER_LOCK=true`; user-supplied URLs are checked

## 🐳 Docker Advanced Topics

### Custom Base Path

If you want to serve Swiparr under a subpath — e.g. `https://jellyfin.example.com/swipe/` — you need to set `URL_BASE_PATH` **at image build time**, not as a runtime environment variable.

**Why?** Next.js bakes asset URLs (`/_next/static/...`) into the compiled output at build time. Setting a base path only at runtime can fix page routing but leaves all JS/CSS/image references pointing at the wrong path, breaking the app. The prefix must be known before the build.

> **The prebuilt image from `ghcr.io` does not support `URL_BASE_PATH`** — it is built without a base path. You must build your own image.

#### If you are not using compose and want to build the image

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m3sserstudi0s/swiparr.git
cd swiparr
docker build --build-arg URL_BASE_PATH=/swipe -t swiparr-custom .
```
Then use `swiparr-custom` as your image name in your docker run command.

#### If you are using compose, compose can build and manage the image for you at runtime

```yaml
services:
  swiparr:
    pull_policy: build
    build:
      context: https://github.com/m3sserstudi0s/swiparr.git
      args:
        URL_BASE_PATH: /swipe
    container_name: swiparr
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - JELLYFIN_URL=http://jellyfin:8096
      - URL_BASE_PATH=/swipe       # must match the --build-arg value exactly
    volumes:
      - ./swiparr-data:/app/data
    ports:
      - 4321:4321
```

> `URL_BASE_PATH` must also be passed as a runtime environment variable so the app generates correct internal links and auth redirects. It must match the `--build-arg` value exactly.

#### Step 3 — Configure your reverse proxy

Forward requests for the subpath to the container. The app handles stripping the prefix internally — **do not strip it in the proxy**.

**Nginx:**

```nginx
location /swipe {
    proxy_pass http://swiparr:4321;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

**Traefik (Docker labels):**

```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"
  - "traefik.http.routers.swiparr.rule=Host(`jellyfin.example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/swipe`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.swiparr.tls=true"
```

**Caddy:**

```caddy
handle /swipe* {
    reverse_proxy swiparr:4321
}
```

---

### Reverse Proxy Configuration (root path)

**Nginx Example:**

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://swiparr:4321;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

**Required Headers:**
- `Host` - Required for authentication
- `X-Forwarded-For` - Client IP for logging
- `X-Forwarded-Proto` - Protocol detection

### Volume Management

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data          # Database & cache
  - ./logs:/app/logs          # Optional: Persist logs
```

### Environment File

Use `--env-file .env` with Docker for cleaner configuration management.
